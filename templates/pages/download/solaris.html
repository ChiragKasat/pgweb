<h1>Solaris packages</h1>

<p><b><a href="/ftp/binary">Download</a></b> Solaris packages from the solaris 
subdirectory of the version you require from our file browser.</p>

<p>Packages for OpenSolaris (PostgreSQL 8.3.0 and above) and Solaris 10 (8.3.1 
and above) are available for Sparc and i386 platforms. Although produced by Sun, 
these packages are not officially supported by them.</p>

<p>Solaris packages are installed by unpacking the compressed tar files
directly into the install directory; see the README files for details.</p>

<p><i>The Solaris PostgreSQL packages are maintained by Bjorn Munch at 
	<a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun Microsystems</a>.</i></p>
